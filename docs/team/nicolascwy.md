### Project: Pocket Hotel

**Pocket Hotel (PH)** is a specialized contact management desktop app targeted towards hotel managers who have many
guests and staff to handle.
Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Extended ability to delete guest details from the archive and contact book.
  * What it does: Allows the user to delete a guests details from the contact book using their passport number.
  * Justification: If a guest details was incorrectly keyed in or has to be cleared from the system, the guest details can be deleted using the passport number.
  * Credits: The original [AB3 code](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1920S1/addressbook-level3) for the initial method of deleting via index.


* **New Feature**: Added the ability to delete vendor details from the contact book using their vendor ID.
  * What it does: Allows the user to delete a guests details from the contact book using their vendor ID.
  * Justification: If a vendor is not used by the hotel, the vendor details can be deleted using the vendor ID.
  * Credits: The original [AB3 code](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1920S1/addressbook-level3) for the initial method of deleting via index.


* **New Feature**: Adapted `delete` tests from Address Book 3 to work for `deletevendor` and `deleteguest` commands.


* **New Feature**: Add the ability to generate invoice containing services charged to a guest.
  * What it does: Generate PDF invoice containing all the vendor services used by a guest.
  * Justification: Invoice can be provided to the guest upon check out, to consolidate items they have to pay for.
  * Highlights: Learning and designing an invoice PDF using an external library([iText7 Core](https://itextpdf.com/en/products/itext-7/itext-7-core))
