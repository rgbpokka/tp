### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="300" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes
called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java)
and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It
is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues
the command `delete vid/123`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding
  API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using
the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component
through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the
implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified
in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `GuestListPanel`, `VendorListPanel`,
, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures
the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that
are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of
the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java)
is specified
in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Guest` and `Vendor` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `PocketHotelParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `CheckInNewGuestCommand`) which is
   executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to check in a guest).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("deletevendor vid/123")` API
call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `deletevendor vid/123` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagramVendor.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteVendorCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:

* When called upon to parse a user command, the `PocketHotelParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a
  placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `CheckInNewGuestCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse
  the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `CheckInNewGuestCommand`) which the `PocketHotelParser` returns back as
  a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `CheckInNewGuestCommandParser`, `DeleteVendorCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser`
  interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

![Model Class Diagram](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

The `Model` component,

* stores the vendorbook and guestbook data i.e., all `Vendor` and `Guest` objects.
* stores the currently 'selected' `Guest` or `Vendor` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which
  is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Guest>` or `ObservableList<Vendor>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to
  this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as
  a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they
  should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="600" />

The `Storage` component,

* can save both vendor book data, guest book data, archive book data, and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding
  objects.
* inherits from `GuestBookStorage`, `VendorBookStorage`, `ArchiveBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only
  the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects
  that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Book Management

**PH** allows the user to manage vendors and guests.

As mentioned in the `Model` section earlier, there are three different types of lists:
1. GuestBook (Management of guests)
2. VendorBook (Management of vendors)
3. Archive (Management of archived guests; currently not exposed to the user)

All the lists are managed by the `ModelManager` which supports some common operations across them, with certain
variations depending on which list we are currently executing the operation on.

Some common operations include:
* `addvendor` for vendors and `checkin` for guests - creates the entity and adds to the respective books.
* `editvendor` for vendors and `editguest` for guests - edits the entity and updates the book accordingly.
* `deletevendor` for vendors and `deleteguest` for guests - removes the existing entity from the respective book.
* `listvendor` for vendors and `listguest` for guest - renders all the entities of the respective book.
* `clearvendor` for vendors and `clearguest` for guest - removes all the entities from the respective book.

By segregating the model into its respective books/lists, we felt that this embraced **OOP** concepts, as it reduces coupling and increases cohesion.

The following class diagram shows the general structure of a `GuestBook`. The same concepts were applied when building the `VendorBook` and `Archive`.

<img src="images/GuestBookClassDiagram.png" width="500" />

The `GuestBook` implements the `ReadOnlyGuestBook` interface. The `getGuestList()` method returns an `ObservableList` of guests. `ObservableList` makes use
of the Observer pattern, as it notifies the `ModelManager` of any changes that occur in the guest list, and reflect those changes onto the **GUI**.

### Toggling between vendor and guest list

Other than toggling between the two lists via the **GUI**. The user can make use of the commands `listguest` and `listvendor` to toggle between the two.
After certain commands like `filterguest` and `filtervendor`, the list also gets toggled automatically for the user. The
toggling is executed depending on the state of the `CommandResult`, after executing the user command.

`MainWindow` has a function `toggleTab()` that reads in the state of the `CommandResult` and renders the correct list accordingly.

The following activity diagram illustrates what happens to the `MainWindow` of the UI component when a user inputs a command.

<img src="images/ToggleTabActivityDiagram.png" width="600" />

### Filter feature

#### Implementation

The filter feature makes use of the `Model#updateFilteredGuestList` and `Model#updateFilteredVendorList` operations,
where each function takes in a `Predicate<Guest>` and `Predicate<Vendor>` respectively. To avoid repetition, we will cover how the
`filterguest` command is implemented. The `filtervendor` command follows the exact same logic with its own unique fields.

The `filterguest` command is facilitated by the `FilterGuestCommandParser` and `FilterGuestCommand` of **PH**. The following sequence diagram shows
how the `filterguest` operation works:

![FilterGuestSequenceDiagram](images/FilterGuestSequenceDiagram.png)

Given above is an example of a user filtering guests by a tag, deluxe. The end result is a filtered list of guests with the tag, deluxe.
The execution of the above example follows the same flow as all the other commands. One important to take note is that, the `FilterGuestCommandParser`
returns a `GuestPredicate`. This `GuestPredicate` implements `Predicate<Guest>`, and the instance instantiated by the parser is what
gets passed into `Model#updateFilteredGuestList` to achieve the end result. `filtervendor` makes use of a class `VendorPredicate` that follows the same idea.

The following activity diagram shows what happens when a user executes a `filterguest` command, `filtervendor` follows the same flow.

![FilterGuestActivityDiagram](images/FilterGuestActivityDiagram.png)

### Deleting a Guest

#### Implementation

The implementation of the `deleteguest` command was largely based off the original AB3 implementation, with changes made
to support the `Archive` and delete by the guest details instead of index in list.
The `deleteguest` makes use off the `GuestBook` and `Archive` class to search for the guest to be deleted.

This is done through the implementation of `Model` called `ModelManager`. The operations
`ModelManager#getGuest(PassportNumber passportNumber)` and`ModelManager#getArchivedGuest(PassportNumber passportNumber)`
are used to check if the guests details can be found in Pocket Hotel (Either in the archive or currently checked in).
If the guest details is found in either locations, it would be deleted.

<img src="images/DeleteSequenceDiagramGuest.png" width="450" />

### Deleting a Vendor

#### Implementation

The implementation of the `deletevendor` command was largely based off the original AB3 implementation, with changes to
made to delete another a different model, `Vendor` and delete by the vendor details instead of index in list.

The difference between the Guest and Vendor model is that Vendors cannot be archived. Therefore, the
implementation of the `deletevendor` command is the same as the `deleteguest` command, but only the `VendorBook`
(the `GuestBook` equivalent for vendors) has to be searched.

<img src="images/DeleteSequenceDiagramVendor.png" width="450" />

### Invoice Generation

#### Implementation

Invoices in Pocket Hotel was created using the [iText7 Core](https://itextpdf.com/en/products/itext-7/itext-7-core)
library, which provides an API to create PDF documents in Java.

The implementation of invoice generation can be found in the `Invoice` class which contains almost all the code
for generating invoices. The `Invoice` class is meant to be used as a static method and should not be
instantiated. It has only one method that has the public access modifier is the static method `Invoice#generatePdfInvoice`
The other static methods are private helper functions to perform the generation of the PDF.

<img src="images/InvoiceBreakdown.png" width="450" />
// todo check that picture is not too small

An invoice has 5 components:

1. Invoice header
2. Billing details: Includes the guest name and their allocated room number
3. The invoice table: Contain services the guest used during their stay as well as the total cost. Each row contains,
the item number (row number), the name of the vendor, their vendor ID, service type,
quantity and cost per unit, as well as line cost (quantity multiplied by cost per unit) are included
4. A short note of thanks
5. Page number

Given below is the sequence diagram of how the invoice is created by `Invoice#generatePdfInvoice`.

<img src="images/GeneratePdfInvoiceSequenceDiagram.png" width="450" />

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo
history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the
following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` — Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` — Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` — Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()`
and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the
initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command
calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes
to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book
state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`
, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing
the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer`
once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once
to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such
as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`.
Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not
pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be
purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern
desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
    * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
    * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

## **Appendix A: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**: Front-desk receptionists at small-scale hotels

* has a need to manage a significant number of contacts (both vendors and guests)
* prefers to have everything centralized in one application
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps
* tired of using pen and paper to keep track of contacts

**Value proposition**: Automate front-desk operations, elevating guest experience and lightens the front desk's workload.
