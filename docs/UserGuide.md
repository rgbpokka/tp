<h3><i>Welcome to the Pocket Hotel User Guide!</i></h3>

**Pocket Hotel (PH)** is a specialized contact management desktop app targeted towards hotel front office staff such as front desk staff who
frequently interact with guests.

**PH** provides a centralized location to store, organize and manage information linked to your guests and vendors employed by the hotel. **PH**
streamlines your workflow and is optimized for use via the _Command Line Interface_ (**CLI**), whilst still embodying
the benefits of a _Graphical User Interface_ (**GUI**). This means that faster typists would have the benefit of carrying out actions faster using our
_Command Line Interface_(**CLI**) than through the _Graphical User Interface_ (**GUI**) using actions such as mouse clicks.
This user guide serves as an entry point for users to get oriented with how **PH** operates and how you may utilize it
fully to integrate it within your hotel management system.

Do not worry if this is your first time using a _CLI_ application, jump to our [Using this Guide](#using-this-guide) section to learn more about how
you are able to use this guide as we intended and become a master in using our application!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# **Features**

**PH**’s features revolve around managing your **guests** and **vendors**. For each command, a short description of its use is
given which is then followed by the format and a short example to help ensure that you have executed the command
correctly.

A quick overview of all the commands can be found in the [command summary](#command-summary).

Certain commands require parameters, which may have constraints. A quick overview of all the underlying
constraints can be found in the [parameter constraints.](#parameter-constraints-section)

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be entered by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `checkin n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `checkin n/John Doe`.

* Parameter prefixes such as `n/` and `pn/` are special keywords that indicate a start of a parameter.

* Fields with square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/Bing Cheng t/VIP` or as `n/Bing Cheng`.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME pn/PASSPORT_NUMBER`, `pn/PASSPORT_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of
  the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit`) will be
  ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
* All fields cannot be empty
* The tag field is optional and can be omitted entirely (You can learn more about tags [here](#Tagging-a-guest-or-vendor).)
</div>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Contacts in Pocket Hotel
There are 2 types of contacts in **PH**, **guests** and **vendors**. Guests represent guests of the hotel, and vendors represent external companies employed by a hotel for services. Guest are identified by their `PASSPORT_NUMBER`
and Vendors are identified by their `VENDOR_ID`. These fields are their **unique identifier**, and no two contacts can have the same unique identifier.

It is possible for **guests** and **vendors** to have the same **unique identifier** for example, `VENDOR_ID` of a vendor is 111 and `PASSPORT_NUMBER` for a guest is 111, as they represent 2 different entities.

Guests and vendors have different parameters, which can be found in the [parameter constraints table](#parameter-constraints-section) or in the command instructions.

## Navigating between guest and vendor list
You have 2 options to navigate between the **guest** and **vendor** list.

Either
1. Click the button on the **GUI** to view the different lists e.g To view the guest list click on the guest button.
![UIHighightingGuestAndVendorListButton](images/UIHighightingGuestAndVendorListButton.png)
2. Use the `listguest` or `listvendor` command to view the respective lists.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>
* Regardless of the list currently being viewed, you are able to execute any command. e.g While viewing the guest list,
  you are able to add a vendor. Toggle back to the vendor list to see the reflected changes.
</div>

## Tagging a guest or vendor
We have implemented a tagging system that allows you to attach labels to **guests** or **vendors**. You are able to see the
tags attached to every guest or vendor, and the `filterguest` and `filtervendor` commands allows you to filter your lists
by fields or even tags! These tags can be used in _any way you like_. One idea is to
note down important details about guest such as adding a "vegetarian" tag to guests who are vegetarian or have other dietary
restrictions.

Every vendor and guest can have more than one tag attached to them, so you are free to integrate your existing system of organising guests or vendors
right into **PH**!

## Archiving guest information
Upon [checking out](#checking-out-a-guest-checkout) a **guest**, their contact is removed from the list, BUT their information is not deleted. It is instead moved
to an archive where the information is stored. This allows you to use the `returncheckin` command to check in the **guest** on their
subsequent visits and saves you the time of entering all their information again.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
**:information_source: Notes:**<br>

* When a guest is in the archive, the `clearguest` and `deleteguest` commands are able to delete this guest.
* You are not able to edit a guest in the archive.
</div>

## Invoice Generation
Upon checking out a **guest**, a **PDF** invoice will be generated in a folder called `Invoices` in the directory that the `PH.jar` is found in. The invoice will be named in the format
`GUEST_NAME YYYY-MM-DD HH-MM-SS.pdf`, where the `YYYY-MM-DD HH-MM-SS` denotes the current year, month, data, hours, minutes and seconds, at the time the invoice was generated.

The invoice contains information such as the guest details and any services
that have been used during the guests stay (See [chargeguest](#charge-a-guest-for-a-service-chargeguest))

[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

#### Filter guest list: `filterguest`

Displays only the **guests** that meet your requirements, as specified by what you wrote in your filter. This helps you
easily find and search through _smaller and more manageable lists_, instead of scrolling through the entire guest list.

Format:
`filterguest [<FILTER_FIELD_NAME>/<FILTER_FIELD_VALUE>]`

Parameters:
* `PASSPORT_NUMBER`: Should only contain alphanumeric characters.
  * The passport number specified by you must _match the guest passport's number exactly_ to be filtered. 
  * E.g. a guest with a `PASSPORT_NUMBER` of `SE1239182` will not be shown in your **GUI** if you run the command `filterguest pn/SE123`
* `NAME`: No constraints on name used.
  * The name specified by you simply needs to _match the guest's name partially_ to be filtered. 
  * E.g. a guest with a `NAME` of `Jeremy Tan` will be shown in the **GUI** if you run the command `filterguest n/jeremy` or `filterguest n/remy`
    * However, running the command `filterguest n/tan jeremy` will not filter the guest.
* `EMAIL`: A valid email address should be used.
  * The email specified by you simply needs to _match the guest's email partially_ to be filtered.
  * E.g. a guest with a `EMAIL` of `jeremytan@example.com` will be shown in the **GUI** if you run the command `filterguest e/tan`
* `ROOM_NUMBER`: Only numbers greater than 0 are valid.
  * The room number specified by you needs to _match with the guest's room number partially_ to be filtered, however the _order is important_, unlike `EMAIL` and `NAME`.
  * E.g. a guest with a `ROOM_NUMBER` of `201` will be shown in the **GUI** if you run the command `filterguest r/2`
    * However, the guest will not be filtered if you run the command `filterguest r/1`. The reason for this is that hotels
    generally have room numbers with its starting number as the floor level. Such as all hotel rooms on level 1, will
    have their room number starting with 1.
    * We felt that this would provide you a more _useful filter_, as running `filterguest r/2` would filter all the guest
    with their room number starting with a 2, and in essence you would be filtering all the guests that are residing in
    the second floor of your hotel. This would mean guests with `ROOM_NUMBER` that do not start with `2` but may have `2`
    in their `ROOM_NUMBER` are not filtered. An example being `102`.
* `TAG`: An optional field, more than one can be included in the command.
  * The tags specified by you need to _match the guest's tags exactly_ to be filtered.
  * E.g. guests with a `TAG` of `VIP` and guests with a `TAG` of `Deluxe` will be filtered if you run the command `filterguest t/vip t/deluxe`
    * Note that guest with either one of the tags gets filtered, they do not have to both tags to get filtered. The same logic applies when more than two tags are supplied by you.

Example:<br>
![FilterAlexWithRoomNumber2Example](images/FilterGuestAlex.png)
`filterguest n/alex r/2`, guests with a `NAME` that contains Alex and have a `ROOM_NUMBER` starting with 2, will be filtered from **PH**.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
**:information_source: Note:**<br>
* Running the `filterguest` command always applies the filter to all your guests in **PH** and not to an already filtered guest list.
* All fields are case-insensitive.
</div>

  * E.g. vendors with `OPERATING_HOURS` that are currently operating will be shown in the **GUI** if you run the command `filtervendor oh/now`
* `TAG`: An optional field, more than one can be included in the command.
  * The tags specified by you need to _match the vendor's tags exactly_ to be filtered.
  * E.g. vendors with a `TAG` of `Cheap` and vendors with a `TAG` of `Good Rating` will be filtered if you run the command `filtervendor t/cheap t/good rating`
    * Note that vendors with either one of the tags gets filtered, they do not have to both tags to get filtered. The same logic applies when more than two tags are supplied by you.

Example:<br>
![FilterOperatingFoodExample](images/FilterOperatingFoodVendor.png)
`filtervendor sn/Food c/>10 oh/now`, vendors with the `SERVICE_NAME` food and provide the service at a `COST` greater
than 10 and have `OPERATING_HOURS` where they are currently operating now will be filtered from **PH**

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
**:information_source: Note:**<br>
* Running the `filtervendor` command always applies the filter to all your vendors in **PH** and not to an already filtered vendor list.<br>
* All fields are case-insensitive.

#### Editing your data directly

The Json files storing **guest** and **vendor** data are found at:
`[JAR file location]/data/guest.json` & `[JAR file location]/data/vendor.json`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
Editing the json file directly should only be done by a user experienced with .json format files.
As failure to follow the correct formatting would result in a corrupted file and would be replace with an empty file.

#### Guest in archive data format

The Json files storing archive guest data are found at:
`[JAR file location]/data/archive.json`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
**:information_source: Note:**<br>
* The archived guests would have the room number and services field emptied in the Json file.
<br>Archived guest are also not shown in the UI. The rationale for this is that a returning guest would provide
his/her details to the receptionist upon checking in to the hotel, hence there is no need for the receptionist to
refer to details of the archived guests in the UI.
